Self-Evaluation
Maintainability & Extensibility
Separation of Concerns: Pure functions, I/O, and state are well separated. This makes it easy to add new features or change logic without affecting unrelated code.
Low Coupling: Each vital check is a single-responsibility function. Adding new vital checks (e.g., blood pressure) is straightforwardâ€”just add a new function and update check_vitals.
High Reliability: Comprehensive unit tests ensure existing features remain stable as new functionality is added.
Future-Proofing
Adding New Vital Signs:
To support new readings, add a new pure function (e.g., is_blood_pressure_ok) and update check_vitals and the Vitals class.
Vendor Integration:
New vendor readings can be encapsulated in the Vitals class or passed to check_vitals as additional parameters.
Dynamic Limits:
Limits can be parameterized (e.g., based on age) by passing them as arguments or storing them in the Vitals class.
Effort & Reliability
Low Effort:
The modular design means changes are localized and do not require refactoring the entire codebase.
High Reliability:
Tests can be easily extended for new features, ensuring continued correctness.
Conclusion:
The code is well-positioned for the rapidly evolving WHDS. It supports easy, reliable extension for new vital signs, vendor integrations, and dynamic limits, all with minimal disruption to existing features.
