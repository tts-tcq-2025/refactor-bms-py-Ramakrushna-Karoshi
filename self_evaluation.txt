Let's re-verify your **monitor.py** against the self-evaluation criteria:

---

## Maintainability & Extensibility

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - ✔️ Pure validation functions (`is_value_in_range`, `is_spo2_ok`, `check_vitals`) are separate from I/O (`print`, `animate_alert`) and state (`Vitals` class).
  - ✔️ The decorator (`alert_on_failure`) cleanly separates alert logic from validation.

- **Low Coupling:**  
  - ✔️ Each vital check is a single-responsibility function.
  - ✔️ To add a new vital (e.g., blood pressure), you would add a new function and update `check_vitals` and `Vitals`.

- **High Reliability:**  
  - ✔️ The structure supports unit testing for each function and method. (Actual tests not shown, but the code is testable.)

---

## Future-Proofing

- **Adding New Vital Signs:**  
  - ✔️ Easy to add new checks by extending `check_vitals` and the `Vitals` class.

- **Vendor Integration:**  
  - ✔️ The `Vitals` class can encapsulate new vendor readings or accept new parameters.

- **Dynamic Limits:**  
  - ✔️ All limits are parameterized and can be passed as arguments or stored in the class.

---

## Effort & Reliability

- **Low Effort:**  
  - ✔️ Modular design means changes are localized (e.g., adding a new vital does not require major refactoring).

- **High Reliability:**  
  - ✔️ The code is structured for easy extension of tests and features.

---

## Conclusion

Your monitor.py matches the self-evaluation:  
- It is modular, extensible, and easy to maintain.
- Adding new vital signs, vendor integrations, or dynamic limits is straightforward and low-risk.
- The code is well-suited for a rapidly evolving system like WHDS.

**No major changes are needed to meet these maintainability and extensibility goals.**
